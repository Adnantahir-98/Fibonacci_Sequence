The <strong>Fibonacci sequence</strong> is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two that precede it. 
Starting at 0 and 1, the sequence looks like this: <strong>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,</strong> and so on forever. The Fibonacci sequence can be described using a 
mathematical equation: <strong>Xn+2= Xn+1 + Xn</strong>.
